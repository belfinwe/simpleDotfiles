# simpleDotfiles
I'm still new to dotfiles, but thought I'd upload what little I have yet here.  
Will be updated as I learn more.  

__.alias__  
Contains a few aliases. How to add them to `.bashrc` in the `.alias`file.  
_2019-04-08:_  
Added `.programs`, which installes misc programs. Which programs are listed as
comments in the file.
  
_2019-04-06:_  
Some commands might need certain programs installed. I've tested with how to 
automaticly install them if they are not installed, firs of was the
`kl`-command, which need `tty-clock`.
